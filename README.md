About the project üîç
This codebase bundles a stable admin command set tailored for study and testing. It exposes common admin actions such as teleport, kick, ban, spawn, model control, and player utilities. Each command has a small handler and clear input pattern. The tool focuses on clarity. It keeps the code modular. You can read, test, and change handlers to learn how admin systems work inside Roblox.

Load and run in Roblox Studio üõ†Ô∏è
This section shows a minimal loader pattern. Use it to attach the tool into your test game.

Server setup
1. Create a ModuleScript in ServerScriptService called AdminCore.
2. Paste the contents of admin-module.lua from the release.
3. Ensure RemoteEvents exist:
   - AdminCommandEvent (RemoteEvent) under ReplicatedStorage
   - AdminResponseEvent (RemoteEvent) under ReplicatedStorage
4. Place command modules in ServerScriptService/AdminCommands or pack them inside the core.

Client setup
1. Add a LocalScript to StarterPlayerScripts named AdminClient.
2. Use the following pattern to send commands from the client:
   - AdminClient listens for a keybind to open a small input panel.
   - The input panel sends the full command text to AdminCommandEvent.
3. The server validates the sender by looking up the player‚Äôs rank.

Example server validation (concept)
- When AdminCommandEvent fires:
  - Check player.UserId in config.owners or config.whitelist
  - Parse command and args
  - Route to handler module: handlers[cmd]:run(player, args)

Common workflows and examples üìö
Run a permissions test
- Add your test account to config.owners.
- Join Studio test.
- Run a harmless command such as walkspeed <yourname> 30.
- Inspect changes in the Workspace and Player objects.

Create a new command
1. Copy a template module named command_template.lua.
2. Implement fields:
   - name = "example"
   - description = "Short description"
   - args = { "player", "value" }
   - run = function(player, args) ... end
3. Register the module in the main loader:
   - handlers["example"] = require(script.ExampleCommand)

Batch spawn models for a map test
- Use spawn <assetId> multiple times.
- Or prepare a CSV list and call spawn in a loop.

Permission test matrix
- Owner -> full access
- Admin -> most commands except serverwide tools
- Moderator -> limited player controls
- Guest -> no commands

Configuration and permission model üîê
The tool uses a simple config pattern. Keep the config in a ModuleScript named AdminConfig. The file exposes keys you can change. Example fields:

- owners = { 123456 }         -- user ids with full power
- admins = { 234567, 345678 } -- user ids with elevated rights
- whitelist = { }             -- optional names allowed to use commands
- blockedCommands = { "shutdown", "serverhop" }
- logEnabled = true
- logsFolder = game.ServerStorage:FindFirstChild("AdminLogs")

Permission flow
1. The module receives a command call.
2. It checks the player.UserId against owners and admins.
3. It checks the command against blockedCommands.
4. If all checks pass, it runs the handler.
5. The handler returns a status and message.
6. The module fires AdminResponseEvent back to the caller.

Throttle and rate limits
- Command calls can run at a rate limit.
- The tool uses a per-player cooldown to avoid spam.
- The cooldown can live in the config as cooldownSeconds.

Command registration
- Each command exports a table with run(player, args) function.
- The main loader collects modules from a folder and registers by name.
- Use consistent names and provide aliases in each module.

Internals and API reference ‚öôÔ∏è
Module layout
- AdminCore (ModuleScript)
  - loader
  - handlers map
  - config
  - logging
- Commands (Folder)
  - bring.lua
  - kick.lua
  - ban.lua
  - spawn.lua
  - walkSpeed.lua
- Client
  - Local UI script
  - Input handling
  - Keybinds
- Remote objects
  - ReplicatedStorage.AdminCommandEvent
  - ReplicatedStorage.AdminResponseEvent

Key functions
- AdminCore:register(commandName, module)
  - Adds a command to the handlers map.
- AdminCore:runCommand(player, commandText)
  - Parses text, resolves command, runs handler.
- AdminCore:validatePlayer(player, command)
  - Checks permission rules and returns boolean.
- AdminCore:log(player, commandText, result)
  - Writes an entry to logsFolder.

Command module interface
Each command module should export:
- name (string)
- description (string)
- aliases (table of string)
- args (table)
- run = function(context)
  - context.player
  - context.args
  - context.rawText
  - Return table { success = true, message = "..." }

Data patterns
- Use Player.Character to access body parts.
- Use Humanoid.Died, Humanoid.Health for health logic.
- Use Instance:Clone to replicate models.

Remote event patterns
- Use RemoteEvent:FireServer for client-to-server calls.
- Validate on server. Validate input types and length.
- Return result via RemoteEvent:FireClient.

Debugging and logs üêû
Logging
- Each command call logs a small JSON-like table.
- Log fields:
  - time
  - userId
  - command
  - args
  - result
- Store logs in ServerStorage.AdminLogs for study.

Runtime debug tips
- Use print statements inside handlers during tests.
- Attach a developer console GUI in Studio to view print output.
- Use warn() when a module fails to load.

Common issues
- Command doesn't run
  - Ensure the user id exists in config.owners or admins.
  - Confirm the command module registers under the correct name.
  - Check AdminCommandEvent exists in ReplicatedStorage.
- Handler errors
  - Open the module and inspect the stack trace in Studio output.
  - Match argument types and counts.
- Asset fails to spawn
  - Confirm the assetId is public or you own the asset.

Appendix ‚Äî Full sample command module
Use this template to add new commands. Replace name, description, args, and run logic.

```lua
-- ExampleCommand.lua
local command = {}
command.name = "example"
command.description = "A short example command"
command.aliases = { "ex" }
command.args = { "player", "value" }

function command.run(context)
  local player = context.player
  local args = context.args
  if not args[1] then
    return { success = false, message = "Missing target" }
  end
  local targetName = args[1]
  local value = args[2]
  -- Example logic: set a value in leaderstats
  local target = game.Players:FindFirstChild(targetName)
  if not target then
    return { success = false, message = "Target not found" }
  end
  local leader = target:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
  if leader and leader:FindFirstChild("Score") then
    leader.Score.Value = tonumber(value) or leader.Score.Value
    return { success = true, message = "Score updated" }
  end
  return { success = false, message = "leaderstats missing" }
end

return command
```

Appendix ‚Äî Example client UI flow
- Press a key to open command input.
- Type a command in the field.
- Press Enter to send it to the server via AdminCommandEvent.
- Receive a response through AdminResponseEvent.
- Show the response in a small toast UI.

Appendix ‚Äî Example admin config
```lua
-- AdminConfig.lua
return {
  owners = { 12345678 },
  admins = { 23456789 },
  whitelist = {},
  blockedCommands = { "shutdown", "serverhop" },
  cooldownSeconds = 2,
  logEnabled = true,
}
```

Large scale lab setup
- Create a private test place with a map and test avatar models.
- Add automated scenarios that exercise movement, teleport, and spawn.
- Track logs to confirm the sequence of events.

Teaching ideas for class or lab
- Break students into teams. Each team writes one command module.
- Run a demo where teams swap modules and debug each other‚Äôs commands.
- Have students implement safe validation for inputs.
- Teach RemoteEvent security by example.

Performance notes
- Avoid heavy work in a command handler. Use tasks or coroutine for long runs.
- For mass spawn, use batching to avoid frame drops.
- Cache frequently used lookups such as player references.

How to extend the logger
- Write a simple exporter that converts logs to CSV.
- Add a web hook that posts logs to a local server for processing.
- Use DataStore for persistent storage if needed in controlled tests.
